Title: CAPS Traversability Metric to Assess Local Connectedness with Resistant Kernels
Version: 2.0.0

Description: CAPS (Conservation Assessment and Prioritization System) traversability metric (also
    known as old-style connectedness and local connectedness).  Builds a resistant kernel
    for each focal cell in landcover using resistances supplied in a table.  In normal
    mode, each focal cell gets the sum of the volume of a resistant kernel built on that
    cell, divided by the sum of a standard kernel built on that cell.  This gives a measure
    of local connectedness for each focal (usually undeveloped) cell in the landscape.
    Alternatively, example points may be specified, and resistant kernels are built for
    each example cell; these kernels are summed where they overlap.
